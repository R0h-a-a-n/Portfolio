# Occlufix – Face Inpainting with Perceptual and Adversarial Losses

Occlufix is a deep learning–based face inpainting model built using a modified U-Net architecture to restore occluded or masked facial regions. The model was trained on the CelebA dataset and leverages both **low-level and high-level supervision signals** to generate photorealistic, structure-preserving results.

---

## Key Features

* **Architecture**: Developed a custom **U-Net-based** model optimized for inpainting facial features with high fidelity and continuity.
* **Dataset**: Trained on the **CelebA dataset** with over **150,000 aligned face images**, using randomized occlusions to simulate real-world maskings.

---

## Loss Functions and Learning Strategy

To improve both visual quality and feature consistency, multiple loss functions were used in tandem:

* **L1 Reconstruction Loss** – Enforces pixel-level fidelity.
* **Perceptual Loss** – Extracted using pretrained **VGG16** features to guide semantic restoration.
* **Style Loss** – Encourages texture consistency via Gram matrix matching.
* **Total Variation Loss** – Penalizes spatial discontinuities in generated regions.
* **Adversarial Losses** – Employed both **PatchGAN** (local consistency) and **Global Discriminator** (overall coherence) using a dual-discriminator setup.

Progressive weighting was applied to each loss component over epochs to balance structural integrity and stylistic realism.

---

## Training and Optimization

Training was conducted on a local machine with an **NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU**, leveraging the following optimizations:

* **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)** for faster training and reduced memory consumption (cut by over **45%**).
* **Gradient Scaling** to stabilize updates in lower-precision modes.
* **Progressive Loss Scheduling**, gradually increasing influence of perceptual and adversarial terms for controlled convergence.

---

## Results and Evaluation

Occlufix successfully restored facial regions with high perceptual quality, preserving identity and contextual features. Key outcomes:

* **Improved SSIM and LPIPS** metrics over baseline L1-only models.
* **Significant reduction in edge artifacts and unnatural textures**.
* **Real-time inference support** for image resolutions up to `256x256`.

## Repository and Code Access

The complete training pipeline, model checkpoints, and inference notebooks are available on GitHub:

```

```

Includes support for:

* Custom mask generation
* Real-time webcam inference (optional)
* Pretrained weights and evaluation scripts

---

## Future Work

Planned improvements include:

* Transition to **Vision Transformer (ViT)**-based encoders
* Integration with **diffusion-based inpainting priors**
* Deployment as a real-time plugin for video conferencing tools

---

Occlufix demonstrates how combining architectural simplicity with rich supervision signals can deliver highly practical and efficient face inpainting performance suitable for real-world use cases.
