# Convidat – AI-Powered Sustainable Tourism Platform

Convidat represents a comprehensive, full-stack AI-powered tourism platform meticulously crafted to champion sustainable and eco-conscious travel. It harnesses the power of advanced machine learning and causal inference, operating in concert with a microservices architecture built on the MERN stack and integrated with external APIs, to deliver personalized, environmentally responsible travel recommendations. This architectural approach ensures modularity, scalability, and robust performance.

## Key Capabilities

The platform offers a suite of functionalities designed to enhance the sustainable travel experience:

* **ML-Powered City Recommendations:** Convidat incorporates a sophisticated collaborative filtering model, leveraging Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to suggest ideal cities. These recommendations are intelligently informed by user context, including seasonality, eco-score, popularity metrics, and individual travel preferences.

* **Sustainable Route Planning:** Seamlessly integrated with the Google Maps API, the platform simulates and recommends eco-friendly transportation modes such as trains, buses, ferries, and flights. For each option, it provides estimated carbon footprints, distances, and costs, empowering users to make environmentally informed travel choices.

* **Trip Planner with Itinerary Builder:** Users gain the ability to meticulously plan multi-day trips, easily adding activities, monitoring real-time weather conditions, generating packing lists, and tracking expenses with currency conversion and real-time savings insights.

* **Carbon Footprint Tracker:** A dynamic calculator is embedded to assess emissions generated from various travel activities and accommodation choices. This feature aids users in actively minimizing their environmental impact throughout their journey.

* **Eco-Stays & Destination Discovery:** The platform curates a selection of eco-friendly accommodations and attractions. This is achieved through intelligent utilization of the Google Places API, combined with a proprietary eco-rating logic based on place types and specific sustainability criteria.

* **Real-Time Reviews with Sentiment Analysis:** Users can provide reviews for destinations and services. These reviews undergo natural language processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis, categorizing experiences as positive, neutral, or negative, providing valuable insights for the community.

* **User Profile & Eco Score Dashboard:** Each user benefits from a personalized eco-impact dashboard. This dashboard showcases average emissions per trip, total emissions saved, and trends in their personal eco-score, fostering a greater awareness of their environmental contribution.

* **JWT Auth & Role-Based Access:** Security is paramount, with secure login and registration facilitated by JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication and meticulously protected route access, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

## Architectural Framework

Convidat is built upon a resilient microservices architecture, comprising eight distinct services designed for specialized functions:

1.  `auth-service`: Manages secure user registration, login, and JWT-based session management.
2.  `carbon-service`: Dedicated to computing carbon emissions associated with travel routes and accommodation.
3.  `destination-service`: Filters and presents destinations based on eco-score, tags, and geographical location.
4.  `recommendations-service`: Houses the SVD-based city recommender, incorporating contextual logic for personalized suggestions.
5.  `trip-planner-service`: Oversees itinerary creation, packing list management, and budget tracking functionalities.
6.  `travel-service`: Interfaces with the Google Maps API to simulate and propose sustainable transportation options.
7.  `review-service`: Executes NLP-based sentiment analysis on user-generated travel reviews.
8.  `profile-service`: Manages user eco-scores, trip history, and summarized emission data.

## Technological Landscape

The platform leverages a contemporary and robust tech stack:

* **Frontend**: React.js, complemented by Tailwind CSS for efficient and stylish UI development.
* **Backend**: Express.js serves as the API Gateway for robust routing, while FastAPI is employed for the high-performance ML services.
* **Database**: MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.
* **ML Models**: Truncated SVD powers the city recommender, while VADER and custom NLP models handle sentiment analysis for reviews.
* **APIs**: Integration with Google Maps and Google Places APIs enriches the platform's location-based services and data.
* **Deployment**: Dockerized microservices, accessible via REST endpoints, ensure ease of deployment and scalability.

## AI Components at the Core

Convidat's intelligence stems from its integrated AI components:

* **Contextual Recommendation:** Sophisticated contextual recommendation logic with fallback mechanisms ensures relevant suggestions even with limited user data.
* **City Similarity:** Leverages city embeddings combined with cosine similarity to identify and recommend similar destinations.
* **Sentiment Scoring:** Employs text preprocessing and fine-tuned transformer-based models (currently in development) for precise sentiment analysis of reviews.
* **Real-Time Carbon Impact Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on carbon impact during the trip planning phase, fostering eco-conscious decisions.

## Demonstrated Outcomes

During testing, Convidat has showcased promising results:

* The recommendation model achieved a **92% top-5 accuracy**, indicating its effectiveness in suggesting relevant cities.
* Average trip planning time was significantly reduced by **40%**, streamlining the user experience.
* The platform successfully encouraged low-carbon travel by presenting greener route suggestions and filtering eco-friendly accommodation options.
* The development resulted in a highly modular and extensible architecture, primed for future scaling and enhancements.

## Future Road Map

Convidat's evolution includes ambitious plans:

* Integration of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based eco-travel assistant for more natural and intuitive user interactions.
* Expansion to include live, event-based destination ranking, providing dynamic insights.
* Migration to a serverless architecture to further optimize cost efficiency and scalability.
* Consideration of gamified eco-badges and community challenges to foster greater user engagement and promote sustainable habits (optional roadmap item).

Convidat transcends the role of a mere travel planner. It represents a dedicated stride towards fostering responsible, mindful, and low-impact tourism, aiming to make sustainable travel a more accessible and appealing choice for everyone.
